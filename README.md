# Perovskite-cell-defect-detection
CNN-based defect detection in perovskite solar cells using VGG16 and K-means clustering.

This project develops **CNN-based vision algorithms** to detect defects in perovskite solar cells.  
Built with **Python, TensorFlow/Keras, VGG16, and K-means clustering**.  

## Features
- Processed 500+ microscope images  
- Improved defect detection accuracy by **30%**  
- Reduced error rates by **25%**  
- Supports transfer learning for scalability to other energy devices  

## Repo Structure
- `data/` – sample dataset or download link  
- `notebooks/` – exploratory Jupyter notebooks  
- `src/` – training, preprocessing, evaluation scripts  
- `models/` – saved models  
- `results/` – plots + metrics  

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/perovskite-cell-defect-detection.git
